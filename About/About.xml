--- Original Description ---
Overview

Modify the following room characteristics:

Impressiveness,
Wealth,
Space,
Beauty,
Cleanliness.

Details

Allows you to tweak the lookup tables (stats) for rooms using mod options that the rooms are scored against and vary their characteristics on a % basis (from 50% to 200%, 100% being default vanilla). E.g. if you set space to 200% then the room scores will remain the same but the values it compares against will be halved in comparison, thus making the impression of space to be better.

Mod Notes

Can be added and removed safely.

Other mods that manipulate the above values will compound the results.

Note: changing the mod options will not apply until after reloading RW.
