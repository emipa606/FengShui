[h1]Overview[/h1] V1.1

Modify the following room characteristics: 

Impressiveness,
Wealth,
Space,
Beauty,
Cleanliness.

[h1]Details[/h1]

Allows you to tweak the lookup tables (stats) for rooms using mod options that the rooms are scored against and vary their characteristics on a % basis (from 50% to 200%, 100% being default vanilla). E.g. if you set space to 200% then the room scores will remain the same but the values it compares against will be halved in comparison, thus making the impression of space to be better.

[h1]Mod Notes[/h1]

Can be added and removed safely.

Other mods that manipulate the above values will compound the results.

Note: changing the mod options will not apply until after reloading RW.
